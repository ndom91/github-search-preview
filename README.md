# github-search-preview

Recreate the search result modal preview feature from [grep.app](https://grep.app) in GitHub! 

Tired of browsing GitHub search results and having to "<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + click" each individual file and then jump back and forth among so many tabs? With this extension you can preview the full file search result directly in-context in a modal on the GitHub search results page.
